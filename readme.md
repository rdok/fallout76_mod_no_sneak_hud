# Fallout 76 Mod - No Sneak Hud
> Hides the sneak indicator when crouched. 

- *Game Version:* 1.6.4.65
- Install with [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).

### Compatibility 
This mod is incompatible with any other mod that modifies the hudmenu.swf file.
Optional files provide support for the most popular mod(s).

- [Better inventory v1.5.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) works out of the box as it does not edits the hudemenu.swf file.
- [Improved Health Bars](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368) Feel free to request in any additional mod to support.
 
### Features
- Hide sneak HUD using normal armor, e.g. combat armor or apparel
- Power armor is not supported; immersion wise speaking, sneaking in said armor does not make sense.

### Deployment

Save the new flash file on a directory, with the following format. The structure is crucial for the system to identify the HUD flash file:mod-root-directory/interface/hudemenu.swf

Use [Fallout 4 Creation Kit - Archive2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946160/Fallout_4_Creation_Kit/) to create the ba2 file. Once installed, this tool is located at `{user_defined_root}\steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Tools\Archive2`
