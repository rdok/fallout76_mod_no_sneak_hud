### Installation
Install with Vortex.

### Compatibility 
This mod is incompatible with any other mod that modifies the hudmenu.swf file.
Optional files provide support for the most popular mod(s).

- [Better inventory v1.5.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) works out of the box as it does not edits the hudemenu.swf file.
- [Improved Health Bars](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368) Feel free to request in any additional mod to support.
 
### Features
- Hide sneak HUD using normal armor, e.g combat armor or apparel
- Power armor is not supported; immersion wise speaking, sneaking in said armor does not make sense.
